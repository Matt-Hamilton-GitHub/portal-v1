    title: "Data Structures",
     desc: `Fundamental dynamic data structures, including linear lists, queues, trees, and other linked structures; arrays strings, and hash tables. Storage management. Elementary principles of software engineering. Abstract data types. Algorithms for sorting and searching. Introduction to the Java programming language. `

     title: "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs",
    desc: `An introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques 
    as means to manage program complexity. Techniques include procedural abstraction; control 
    abstraction using recursion, higher-order functions, generators, and streams; data 
    abstraction using interfaces, objects, classes, and generic operators; and language abstraction 
    using interpreters and macros. The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including 
    functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches. It includes an introduction to asymptotic
     analysis of algorithms. There are several significant programming projects.`

        title: "Modern Cryptography",
       desc: `Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).`
